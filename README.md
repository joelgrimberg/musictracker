# Qxperts Training App

## Connected to the Cypress Cloud

Within Github Actions we connect our testruns to the Cypress Cloud, so we can get acquainted with the Cypress Cloud Platform.

## Connected to Replay.io

Withing Github Actions we make sure our testruns are recorded by Replay.io
Using Replay.io we can then replay the testrun and see what happened during the testrun and debug the recorded tests.

At the moment we make use of a free Replay.io account, and have therefore no single sign on.

If you want to gain insights in the recorded testruns, please use this link to get into the [Replay.io dashboard](https://app.replay.io/team/invitation?code=bb4a63e1-95cb-40ec-bdba-a70c544f4fa4)
